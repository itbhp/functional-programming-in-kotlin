# functional-programming-in-kotlin

This repo contains all the exercise from the book Functional Programming in Kotlin by Paul Chiusano, RÃºnar Bjarnasson
and Marco Vermuellen.

The arrow version of this repo cannot be updated to 1.x or later because they removed all higher kinded types
encoding in those versions.
